# CS50 SQL Projects

This repository contains my personal notes, insights, and learning reflections based on the CS50's [Introduction to Databases with SQL](https://cs50.harvard.edu/sql/2024/) course by Harvard.

📌 **Important Note**  
This repository does **not** contain any actual solutions or `.sql` files from the course problem sets to respect Harvard's academic honesty policy. All content here is original, written in my own words, and intended as a reflection on the concepts I learned.

## 📌 Why This Repo?

I wanted a place to document my journey in learning SQL through CS50’s brilliant teaching. Instead of sharing code, I focused on explaining **what I learned** and **how I approached the problems**, in a way that's ethical and helpful to others.
