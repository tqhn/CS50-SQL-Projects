## 🔍 Problem Summary

The task involved identifying prints by the famous artist Hokusai from a museum’s database, which contains details of hundreds of artworks.

## 🧠 Key Concepts Used

- `SELECT`, `WHERE`, `LIKE`
- Filtering text using pattern matching
- Using string functions and understanding when data isn't normalized

---

## 🧵 My Approach

I filtered records in the `views` table by using the `LIKE` operator to identify all artworks by "Hokusai", especially his iconic "Thirty-six Views of Mount Fuji" series. I explored how artist names were stored and matched titles using wildcards.

## 📝 What I Learned

- How to work with partial string matches using `LIKE '%keyword%'`
- Importance of clean, consistent data when filtering
- Practice in reading and interpreting real-world, messy metadata
